# AutoMod

## How do I add the bot?
Feel free to invite the bot by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697487580522086431&scope=bot&permissions=403041534). Note that the bot will need certain permissions in order to work. I'd suggest enabling the "administrator" permissions for its role. If you don't want to do that, simply give it the perms you are comfortable with giving it.

Yes:
